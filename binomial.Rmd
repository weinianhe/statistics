Binomial Coefficent Formula sometimes call combination (order doesn't matter)
For k<= n, (n k) = n(n-1)...(n-k+1) / k! = n!/((n-k)!k!)
For k>n, (n k) = 0.


Permutation: (n,r) = n! / (n-r)!

(8,5) = 8!/ ((8-5)!5!) = 8!/ (3!5!)
(8,3) = 8!/ ((8-3)!3!) = 8!/ (5!3!)

How many ways ABABABBB to be permutated. choose where 3A'S goes in the 8 slots ( or equivalent where 5B) goes.


Probably of full house. three cards of some rank, and two cards of another rank. three 7's and two 10's in any order. https://www.thoughtco.com/standard-deck-of-cards-3126599

13 (4,3) 12 (4,2) / (52, 5) = 3744/2598960 ~= 0.00144.










This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
