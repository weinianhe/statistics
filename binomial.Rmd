Binomial Coefficent Formula sometimes call combination (order doesn't matter)
For k<= n, (n k) = n(n-1)...(n-k+1) / k! = n!/((n-k)!k!)
For k>n, (n k) = 0.

```{r}
C_wo <-combn(1:4,3) #generate all the possible combination
choose(4,3) # mathmatically computes the value
4*3*2 / (3*2*1) # expand in formula
factorial(4)/ (factorial(4-3) * factorial(3)) # expand algerbric formula
ncol(C_wo) # count number of column to get the same result.
```

```{r}
choose(49,6)
C_wo <- combn(1:49,6)
C_wo[, 1:10]
ncol(C_wo)
```


Permutation: (n,r) = n! / (n-r)!

(8,5) = 8!/ ((8-5)!5!) = 8!/ (3!5!)
(8,3) = 8!/ ((8-3)!3!) = 8!/ (5!3!)

How many ways ABABABBB to be permutated. choose where 3A'S goes in the 8 slots ( or equivalent where 5B) goes.


Probably of full house. three cards of some rank, and two cards of another rank. three 7's and two 10's in any order. https://www.thoughtco.com/standard-deck-of-cards-3126599

13 (4,3) 12 (4,2) / (52, 5) = 3744/2598960 ~= 0.00144.




(n k) = n(n-1)...(n-k+1) / k! = n!/((n-k)!k!)
n * (n-1, k-1) = k (n, k)
n * ((n-1)(n-1-1)... ((n-1)-(k-1)+1)) / (k-1)!
n * (n-1)(n-2)...(n-1-k+1+1) /(k-1)!
n (n-1) (n-2) ... (n-k+1)/ (k-1)!  = k * (n) (n-1)... (n-k+1) / k! = (n)(n-1)...(n-k+1) / (k-1)!

Vandermonde's Identity
(m+n, k) = \sum_j=0^k (m,j) (n, k-j)
Story proof Consider a group of 𝑚 peacocks and 𝑛 toucans, from which a set of size 𝑘 birds will be chosen. There are (𝑚+𝑛,𝑘) possibilities for this set of birds. If there are 𝑗 peacocks in the set, then there must be 𝑘−𝑗 toucans in the set. The right-hand side of Vandermonde's identity sums up the cases for 𝑗.

For any events 𝐴1,…,𝐴𝑛,

𝑃(⋃𝑖=1𝑛𝐴𝑖)=∑𝑖𝑃(𝐴𝑖)−∑𝑖<𝑗𝑃(𝐴𝑖∩𝐴𝑗)+∑𝑖<𝑗<𝑘𝑃(𝐴𝑖∩𝐴𝑗∩𝐴𝑘)−…+(−1)𝑛+1𝑃(𝐴1∩⋯∩𝐴𝑛).


This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
